<h1>Car Factory Application</h1>

<h2>Part 1</h2>

Create a Java project.  The project solution and package folder should both be named p2<your student id> e.g. p23048201  (check you have done this correctly before continuing)

Create the following classes as per the UML Class diagram (figure 1).

<h2>Implementation Details</h2>

The acceptable range for the horsepower value is between 0 and 1000 (inclusive). Any attempt to set the value outside this range should result in the value being set to -999.
 
displayAll() : The displayAll method for each class should display to screen all the instance variables for the particular class to screen. For example, for a FamilySaloon it should display the make, model, horsePower and   An example output format for the FamilySaloon is shown in figure 2.

<h2>Part 2</h2>

Create a CarFactory class. 

Within the main method of the CarFactory class create several of the car objects and store each car object in an array. Use the array to help output the details for each object via the displayAll() method for each object. The Test data and expected output is shown in figure 3.

Add additional functionality to the CarFactory class to search the car objects:

To find the car(s) with the least horsePower. Output only the model of the car(s).

Output all details of the car(s) of make.

Output the average horsePower for all the car objects. (Display to two decimal places).
